Cloud computing allows us to utilize technology as a service, leveraging remote resources on-demand, on a pay-as-you-model. There are three main service models available on the cloud—Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). 

IaaS provides the fundamental compute, network, and storage resources for customers on-demand. 

PaaS provides customers the hardware, software, and infrastructure to develop, deploy, manage, and run applications created by them or acquired from a third-party.

SaaS provides access to users to a service provider’s cloud-based software. Users simply access the applications on Cloud while the Cloud provider maintains the infrastructure, platform, data, application code, security, availability, and performance of the application.
